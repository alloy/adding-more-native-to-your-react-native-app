### What will you learn from this presentation?

- What native package ‘linking’ is
- How to use it for iOS and Android platforms

## What is it and what problems does it solve?

First, let’s talk about ‘linking’ _outside_ of the context of React Native.

Perhaps you may have thought it was related to `npm link` / `yarn link`; however, beyond both making dependencies whose
source exists on a local file-system available to a project, these tools are meant to allow one to _work_ on those
dependencies and take their name from ‘symbolic link’, the manner in which they are made available to an application. In
case you were not thinking this–never mind me, let’s carry on.

Instead, the origins lie with tooling thats exist in native tool-chains, such as those used for languages like `C`, the
term ‘linking’ refers to building up a working executable from various compiled modules–referred to as ‘object files’,
that contain the compiled ‘object code’ corresponding to input source files. These can either be ‘statically’ linked,
which basically just copies over the ‘object code’ into the executable; or they can be ‘dynamically’ linked, meaning the
‘object code’ is provided as a separate binary to the executable and loaded into memory at runtime. Why you would choose
one over the other is beyond the scope of this presentation, but suffice it to say that for a native dependency’s code
to be available to the application it needs to be linked in either of these manners.

‘Linking’ in the context of React Native _refers_ to this process, but in reality only covers _configuring_ your project
for the actual linker machinery to be able to do its work at build time. This is the part that the rest of this
presentation is concerned about.

## How was this done historically (for iOS)?

Now that we understand what linking refers to in the context of React Native, let’s take a look at how this was done
over the years in an iOS project.

### Manual

As taken from [the React Native documentation](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/linking-libraries-ios#manual-linking),
a native package is expected to come with a Xcode project that instructs Xcode how to build a static library out of the
package’s native source.

1. The user adds a reference to the package’s Xcode project to their own (app) Xcode project;
1. after which they are able to select the package’s static library from the list of libraries their application should
   link against;
1. and finally, where necessary, update build settings of the app Xcode project required by the dependency, such as
   including the correct C++ standard library.
1. If, at runtime, you are only using the package through JavaScript then you are done now. If you also need to use the
   package’s code from your own native code, you will need to setup header search paths so you can include the package’s
   headers in your source files.
1. If the package has any native dependencies of its own, you need to repeat the above steps for those dependencies.

### Automated

An automated version of the exact same approach has existed for a while now, through the `link` command of the
`react-native` command-line tool, in that it will actually edit your Xcode project on-disk. One limitation with this
approach was that the tool doesn’t know about **native** transitive dependencies, and as such in those cases you would
still have to perform the manual approach for those dependencies.

### What problems exist with this approach?

1. In an ideal scenario, you would have to perform 2 steps to manually integrate a single native package, at worst
   including additional build settings and multiplied by the number of **native** transitive dependencies the native
   package has. Even in the automated case, the inconsistency in handling **native** transitive dependencies isn’t the
   greatest developer-experience.
1. Needing to understand the build settings of Xcode and its underlying tooling. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing,
   things _can_ and _will_ break and it’s good to know how things work under the hood, but _having_ to do this each time
   even when on the happy path isn’t ideal.
1. Other than bookkeeping, there’s no easy way to track which build settings originated from what dependency, which
   becomes a maintenance burden when you want to upgrade or remove dependencies.

## Alternative and the future of React Native linking

This is where relying on dependency managers comes in. Respective ecosystems already have dependency management
solutions that are able to deal with all of the above, so in the spirit of standing on the shoulders of giants, let’s
leverage those domain specific tools instead!

In the case of iOS, the popular option is [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org)–which given a manifest that describes a
project’s dependencies, similarly to a `package.json` file, will perform all of the aforementioned work _and_ do so in a
maintainable manner. For instance, it is able to resolve and install transitive dependencies like any other dependency,
it encapsulates dependency specific build settings in `xcconfig` files, and does so with minimal _one-time_ changes to
your app’s Xcode project.

Seeing as sooner or later most people will have to deal with linking native packages and the different ways in which you
had to maintain your app’s Xcode project, the React Native maintainers decided to make utilizing CocoaPods the default
since [version 0.60](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/blog/2019/07/03/version-60#cocoapods-by-default). (Gradle,
for Android apps, was already the default.)

So, great–now there’s a single place where you manage your native dependencies! But given this standardization, we can
take it one step further and automate the process. 🐢s all the way down!

### Auto-linking

Enter auto-linking, which is a new addition to the `react-native` command-line tool that discovers packages that have
native requirements and offloads the responsibility of configuring the app project to the dependency manager for the
respective platform.

For iOS, this means that adding a native package boils down to:

1. Install the package, e.g. `yarn add lottie-react-native`.
1. Run `pod install`.
1. There’s no step 3.

What this does under the hood, is that the CocoaPods manifest, the `Podfile`, includes a React Native specific helper,
which on `pod install` will ask the `react-native` command-line tool for a list of all the native packages and their
corresponding `podspec` files–which are the files that describe to CocoaPods how to build the library. It then
**dynamically** includes those dependencies in its set of dependencies to resolve, as if they were all explicitly
specified in the manifest.

For instance, given a `Podfile` that includes the helper like so:

```ruby
require_relative "../node_modules/@react-native-community/cli-platform-ios/native_modules"
```

…and with `lottie-react-native` as an example, this is what the helper will invoke:

```
$ npx --quiet react-native config
```

…and this is [part of] what `react-native` reports back to CocoaPods:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "lottie-react-native": {
      "root": "/path/to/project/node_modules/lottie-react-native",
      "name": "lottie-react-native",
      "platforms": {
        "ios": {
          "sourceDir": "/path/to/project/node_modules/lottie-react-native/src/ios",
          "folder": "/path/to/project/node_modules/lottie-react-native",
          "pbxprojPath": "/path/to/project/node_modules/lottie-react-native/src/ios/LottieReactNative.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj",
          "podfile": null,
          "podspecPath": "/path/to/project/node_modules/lottie-react-native/lottie-react-native.podspec",
          "projectPath": "/path/to/project/node_modules/lottie-react-native/src/ios/LottieReactNative.xcodeproj",
          "projectName": "LottieReactNative.xcodeproj",
          "libraryFolder": "Libraries",
          "sharedLibraries": [],
          "plist": [],
          "scriptPhases": []
        },
        "android": {
          "sourceDir": "/path/to/project/node_modules/lottie-react-native/src/android",
          "folder": "/path/to/project/node_modules/lottie-react-native",
          "packageImportPath": "import com.airbnb.android.react.lottie.LottiePackage;",
          "packageInstance": "new LottiePackage()"
        }
      },
      "assets": [],
      "hooks": {},
      "params": []
    }
  }
}
```

Given this, the helper will read the `podspec`:

```ruby
Pod::Spec.new do |s|
  s.name         = "lottie-react-native"
  s.source_files  = "src/ios/**/*.{h,m,swift}"
  s.dependency "lottie-ios", "~> 3.1.3"
end
```

…and dynamically add the native dependency, as if it were specified like so:

```ruby
pod "lottie-react-native", :path => "../node_modules/lottie-react-native"
```

This will in turn resolve the dependency, its transitive dependencies, and setup the Xcode projects accordingly:

```
$ pod install
Detected React Native module pod for lottie-react-native
Analyzing dependencies
Downloading dependencies
Installing lottie-ios (3.1.3)
Installing lottie-react-native (3.2.1)
```
